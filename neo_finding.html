		<h3>The story of how Neo came into my life.</h3>

		<p>Neo was found as a stray. He came to my door not looking so hot. He had a lot of superficial injuries to the head, chest and ears. As well as malnourished. However, he was extremely friendly (and vocal) just wanting some pets and some food. </p>
		
		
		<p>The plan was to get him neutered, and for his body to heal and then to let him decide if he wanted back out or not.</p>
		
		<p>He was not happy to be inside at all as he healed.</p>

		<p>Once healed, he was allowed to go back outside. However, he always came back. <br> I would leave for work; so would he. I came home; so did he.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually he acclimated to the life of an indoor only cat.</p>
